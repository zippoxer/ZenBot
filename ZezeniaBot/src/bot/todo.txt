LEGEND:
* = definetly needs to be done.
? = not sure if should be done.
! = critical.

ZenBot v1.0:

OBLIGATORY:
* DONE Displaying waypoints on minimap if user wants to.
* DONE Insert waypoints to the list by default, after adding a new waypoint - select it.
* DONE Fix the bug with targeting in CreaturesFrame.
* DONE Make the Healing actually heal (requires reworked inventory).
* DONE Make an option for food eating (possibly one checkbox in MainFrame) - requires reworked inventory.
* DONE Re-work InventoryFrame to be more user-friendly (use buttons with icons?).
* DONE Make the looting more advanced (search for an alternative container once the one used is full).
* DONE Access to waypoints list should be synchronized in all sources.
  Otherwise ConcurrentModificationException sometimes crashes the Cavebot (most often while setting waypoints)
? DONE Creatures selected in CreaturesList should be highlighted on the minimap (lighter red color possibly).
* DONE Cavebot: automatically eat from corpse.
? DONE Hook up "Show waypoints" and "Eat food" with UserSettings.
* DONE MainFrame: fix or remove the shortcuts.
* DONE The future of logging in:
    1st tab: bot account -> 2nd tab: char list + user/pass
    char list -> direct login
    user/pass -> dialog with character list (like it is now) -> world login
* DONE Analyze and describe the "unknown packet of id 21" (note: it doesn't have to actually be a packet 21, might be an error while reading a merged packet).
  This packet is sent when another player fights creatures and we see it.
  Probably sent on creatures death. The error in reading this packet causes the creatures to not be removed from list -
  - PacketReceiver is unable to reach CreatureDisappearPacket in such case (probably).
* OBSOLETE Saving tiles in CavebotSettings.

* Cavebot: Loot all except listed below



ADDITIONAL:
? Reading the .minimap format somehow... an option to set waypoints using this would be GREAT.
